# Python Script Collection: Image Classification

This repository contains Python scripts for performing image classification, a fundamental task in computer vision. These scripts demonstrate the basics of loading, processing, and classifying images using machine learning models.

## Getting Started

Each script is designed to load images, preprocess them, and classify them based on pre-trained models or custom classifiers. Ensure you have Python 3.x and any necessary libraries installed on your system.

## File Descriptions

1. **1_Image classification 2.py**: A script for image classification that likely includes functionality for loading and classifying images using a model. This may include additional features or improvements over the other image classification script.

2. **1_Image_classification.py**: Another script for image classification, potentially demonstrating a simpler or alternate approach to loading and classifying images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model being used)
- OpenCV (for image processing)

To install required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python
