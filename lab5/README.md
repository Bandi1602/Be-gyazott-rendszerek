# Python Script Collection: Interactive and Predictive Functions

This repository contains Python scripts that offer interactive and predictive functionalities, such as compass direction indicators, weather forecasting, altitude prediction, and a virtual walking pet. These scripts are designed to demonstrate various programming concepts, from input handling to basic prediction models.

## Getting Started

Each script can be run independently and requires Python 3.x. No additional dependencies are necessary unless noted within individual scripts.

## File Descriptions

1. **4Piont_Compass.py**: Implements a basic 4-point compass, likely outputting direction based on given inputs. Useful for learning about conditional statements and directional logic.

2. **6_Weather_Forecast.py**: Simulates or predicts weather conditions based on provided parameters. This script may include simple predictive models or predefined patterns.

3. **8_Altitude_prediction.py**: Provides altitude predictions, possibly using mathematical models or algorithms to estimate altitude changes over time.

4. **11_Walking_Pet.py**: A virtual "walking pet" simulation that interacts with the user, showcasing basic animation or state changes to mimic walking.

5. **14_8Piont_Compass.py**: Extends the functionality of the 4-point compass to an 8-point compass, offering more directional options for a refined navigation experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required beyond Python's standard library.

## Usage

To run any of these scripts, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the scripts, and execute with:

```bash
python script_name.py
